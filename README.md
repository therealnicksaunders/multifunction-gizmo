# multifunction-gizmo

It is my dream to work on [PureScript](http://www.purescript.org/) with [Halogen](https://github.com/slamdata/purescript-halogen) professionally—or at least [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/)—but circumstances dictate that [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) will have to do for now. In an effort to save my brains from turning to mush, I have implemented this quick 'n' dirty architectural example that roughly follows [The Elm Architecture](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/).
